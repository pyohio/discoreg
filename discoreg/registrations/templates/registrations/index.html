    <p>PyOhio is using Discord for attendee chat during the conference. Join us for conversation about the talks, sprints, open spaces, and more. In order to join the PyOhio server you will need a Discord account and a (free!) PyOhio registration using the same email address as your Discord account.</p>
    <div class="box">

        <p>To be added to our Discord server you need to register for the conference using the same email address as your Discord account.

        <p>Log in to your existing Discord.com account or create a new one.</p>
        <p>Note: The email address for your Discord account must match your PyOhio registration. If you already registered using 
        a different email address, you may register again with the matching address. There is no need to cancel your duplicate registration.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">3. Link your Registration</h2>
        <p>The link below will take you to a Discord page asking you to give us permission to see your Discord account email address and to add your account to our server. We will use this to validate your registration and then add you to the server.</p>
